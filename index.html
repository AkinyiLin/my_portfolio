      <h3>Dawa Aquifer Assesment</h3>
      <p>Dawa aquifer, transcending across three East African
        countries that is Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia serves as a
        critical water resource for the three countries by serving
        local communities . The project included collecting data
        from primary and secondary sources to map the aquifer
        hence providing insights for its assessment.</p>

      <h3>Developmemt of TTWCA Digital Circuit Map</h3>
      <p>Conducted some ground truthing to enhance and validate data
        for static and digital map designs for TTWCA in Taita Taveta
        County. Designed well detailed static maps that would later be
        used in the design of the digital circuit map. The goal was to  
        ensure that there are accurate representations of the attraction
        sites and the products within the circuits and other points of
        interest.</p>

      <h3>Effects of Cyclones Australia</h3>
      <p>Cyclone Alfred hit the Australias Western side that is 
        Queensland State in March 2025. Properties was damaged in the 
        process including roads,railway truck and buildings.This project
        aimed to quantify the damage due to the cyclone. Using data from 
        remote sensing  pre and post cylcone mapping was done to highlight 
        regions that were repeatedly affected by cyclone induced flooding.</p>

      <h3>Waste management in Kakamega</h3>
      <p>From primary data of waster collection sites in Kakamega County, 
        maps were desighned on various  waste collection sites in the county.
        The maps were categorized to show the type of waste collected in each
        collection site. The goal was to ensure that there are accurate 
        locations of various waste types for the purposes of recycling waste 
        and environmental conservation.</p>

      <h3>School Feeding Project in Kenya and Tanzania</h3>
      <p>Mapped schools reached by the project in both Kenya and Tanzania. 
        Designed well detailed static maps in different categories.</p>

      <h3>Somalia Urban Planning</h3>
      <p>Collected data from secondary sources on buildings and roads 
        in various parts of Somalia .The buildings were divided using
        features such as roads.Well designed maps of buildings in 
        various sections were generated to assist in fieldwork.</p>

      <h3>Creation of Rwanda Stormwater Geodatabase</h3>
      <p>Using ArcGIS,file geodatabase was created to store various features 
        of stormwater plan project in Rwanda. These features were collected 
        from both primary and secondary sources. The aim of the project was 
        to have a comprehensive geodatabase of all the data of the features
        that were collected and their maps in one place.</p>

      <h3>Assesing link between wildebeest migration and vegetation abundance</h3>
      <p>Using satelite imagery data such as NDVI,EVI,precipitation,evapotranspiration
        and wildebeest occurence data in Mara Ecosytem ,the link between wildebeest 
        migration and vegetation abundance was assesed. Different maps were generated 
        across various epochs.</p>

      <h3>Rapid mapping of historical changes in mangrove vegeation forest and hydrological flows</h3>
      <p>This study used remote sensing data and analytical methods to track historical
        cahnges in the manrove area and measure sand buildup in the bay. Maps were generated 
        to provide preminary products for decision support for the ecosystem.</p>
