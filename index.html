      <h3>Dawa Aquifer Assesment</h3>
      <img src="images/project1.png" alt="Dawa Aquifer Assessment Map">
      <p>Dawa aquifer, transcending across three East African
        countries that is Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia serves as a
        critical water resource for the three countries by serving
        local communities.The project included collecting data from
        primary and secondary sources to map the catchment and aquifer
        hence providing insights for its assessment.</p>

      <h3>Developmemt of TTWCA Digital Circuit Map</h3>
      <img src="images/project2.png" alt="TTWCA Map">
      <p>Conducted some ground truthing to enhance and validate data
        for static and digital map designs for TTWCA in Taita Taveta
        County. Designed well detailed static maps that would later be
        used in the design of the digital circuit map. The goal was to  
        ensure that there are accurate representations of the attraction
        sites and the products within the circuits and other points of
        interest for tourism and conservation efforts.</p>

      <h3>Mapping Recurrent Damage on Infrastructure by Cyclones in Australia</h3>
      <img src="project3.png" alt="Cyclone Alfred Map">
      <p>Cyclone Alfred hit the Australia's Western side that is Queensland 
        State in March 2025. Properties worth millions were damaged in the 
        process including roads,railway truck and buildings.This project
        aimed to quantify the damage due to the cyclone. Using data from 
        remote sensing,  pre and post cylcone mapping was done to highlight 
        regions that were repeatedly affected by cyclone induced flooding.</p>

      <h3>Waste Management in Kakamega</h3>
      <img src="project4.png" alt="Kakamega Waste Collection Map">
      <p>From primary data of waste collection sites in Kakamega County, 
        maps were designed to spatially categorize various  waste collection sites in the county.
        The project aimed to ensure that there are accurate locations of various waste collection
        types to enhance recycling efforts and improve sustainable waste managemnt using GIS.</p>

      <img src="image/project6.png" alt="Somalia Spatial Planning">
      <p>Conducted spatial mapping in some cities in Somalia by extracting building footprints
        from Open Street Map and segmenting them into various sections using road networks with
        buffer zones. Calculated the number of buidlings per section to facilitate effiecient fieldwork
        planning.</p>

      <h3>Creation of Rwanda Stormwater Geodatabase</h3>
      <img src="image/project7.png" alt="Rwanda Stormwater Geodatabase">
      <p>Developed file geodatabase using ArcGIS to store and manage multiple spatial features
        for stormwater planning project in Rwanda. The geodatabase integrated features that were collected 
        from both primary and secondary sources. The aim of the project was to have a comprehensive
        geodatabase of all the data of the features that were collected and used with their associated
        maps for centralized data management.</p>

      <p>Using satelite imagery data such as NDVI,EVI,precipitation,evapotranspiration
        and wildebeest occurence data in Mara Ecosytem ,the link between wildebeest 
        migration and vegetation abundance was assesed. Different maps were generated

      <h3>Rapid mapping of historical changes in mangrove vegeation forest and hydrological flows</h3>
      <p>This study used remote sensing data and analytical methods to track historical
        changes in the mangrove area and measure sand buildup in the bay. Maps were generated 
        to provide preminary products for decision support for the Marereni ecosystem.</p>
