    <div class="project">
      <h3>Dawa Aquifer Assessment</h3>
      <p>Dawa aquifer transcending across three East African countries that is Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia serves as a critical water resource for the three countries by serving local communities.The project included collecting data from primary and secondary sources to map the catchment and aquifer hence providing insights for its assessment.</p>
      <div class="status-badge completed">Completed</div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Development of TTWCA Digital Circuit Map</h3>
      <p>Conducted some ground truthing to enhance and validate data for static and digital map designs for TTWCA in Taita Taveta County. Designed well detailed static maps that would later be used in the design of the digital circuit map. The goal was to ensure that there are accurate representations of the attraction sites and the products within the circuits and other points of interest for tourism and conservation efforts.</p>
      <div class="status-badge completed">Completed</div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Mapping Recurrent Damage on Infrastructure by Cyclones in Australia</h3>
      <p>Cyclone Alfred hit the Australia's Western side that is Queensland State in March 2025. Properties worth millions were damaged in the process including roads, railway tracks and buildings.This project aimed to quantify the damage due to the cyclone Using data from remote sensing pre and post cylcone mapping was done to highlight regions that were repeatedly affected by cyclone induced flooding.</p>
      <div class="status-badge completed">Completed</div>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Waste Management in Kakamega</h3>
      <p>From primary data of waste collection sites in Kakamega County, maps were designed to spatially categorize various waste collection sites in the county. The project aimed to ensure that there are accurate locations of various waste collection types to enhance recycling efforts and improve sustainable waste managemnt using GIS.</p>
      <div class="status-badge completed">Completed</div>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>School Feeding Project in Kenya and Tanzania</h3>
      <p>Conducted spatial mapping of project supported schools in both Kenya and Tanzania. Designed well detailed static maps into different thematics categories.</p>
      <div class="status-badge completed">Completed</div>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Somalia Urban Planning</h3>
      <p>Conducted spatial mapping in some cities in Somalia by extracting building footprints from Open Street Map and segmenting them into various sections using road networks with buffer zones. Calculated the number of buidlings per section to facilitate effiecient fieldwork planning.</p>
      <div class="status-badge completed">Completed</div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Creation of Rwanda Stormwater Geodatabase</h3>
      <p>Developed file geodatabase using ArcGIS to store and manage multiple spatial features for stormwater planning project in Rwanda. The geodatabase integrated features that were collected from both primary and secondary sources. The aim of the project was to have a comprehensive geodatabase of all the data of the features that were collected and used with their associated maps for centralized data management.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Assessing the Link Between Wildebeest Migration and Vegetation Abundance</h3>
      <p>Using satelite imagery data such as NDVI, EVI, precipitation, evapotranspiration and wildebeest occurence data in Mara Ecosytem, the link between wildebeest migration and vegetation abundance was assesed. Different maps were generated across various epochs.</p>

      <h3>Rapid Mapping of Historical Changes in Mangrove Vegetation and Hydrological Flows</h3>
      <p>This study used remote sensing data and analytical methods to track historical changes in the mangrove area and measure sand buildup in the bay. Maps were generated to provide preminary products for decision support for the Marereni ecosystem.</p>
      <div class="status-badge completed">Completed</div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Salt Ponds Influence on Mangrove Forests Degradation</h3>
      <p>This ongoing study examines the influence of salt ponds on mangrove forests degradation in Marereni. Currently, there is a literature review to provide existing knowledge on the topic and baseline geospatial maps of features such as roads, buildings, landcover and saltponds have been designed to assist in the project.</p>
